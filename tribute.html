<ul  style="display: inline-block; text-align: left; " class="cont">
<li><p><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li></p>
<li><p><strong>1933</strong> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks <BR>to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li></p>
<li><p><strong>1935</strong> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <BR>Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed<BR> them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li></p>
<li><p><strong>1937</strong> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li></p>
<li><p><strong>1938</strong> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget<BR> cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under <br>Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li></p>
<li><p><strong>1941</strong> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is<br> rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT<br>  to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li></p>
<li><p><strong>1942</strong> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li></p>
<li><p><strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife,<br> and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years,<br> his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different <br>varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li></p>
<li><p><strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li></p>
<li><p><strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American <br>breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95%<br> of Mexico's wheat.</li></p>
<li><p><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian<br> subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding<br> population</li></p>
<li><p><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li></p>
<li><p><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li></p>
<li><p><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li></p>
<li><p><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically <br>modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says <br>that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants<br> and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li></p>
<li><p><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li></p>
